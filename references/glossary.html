<li><strong>watershed</strong>: for a given stream, (or river, or any body of water), its watershed is all the land where rainwater will eventually flow into the stream (or river or body of water).  Expert usage: "If Waller Creek's watershed has a lot of impervious cover, we should expect flash floods."</li>
