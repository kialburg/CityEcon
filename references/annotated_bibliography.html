        <p class="bibitem-p" >A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.
        It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and
        what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and
        safety, protect the environment, plan for the future). Zoning
        doesn&#8217;t  even  &#8221;solve&#8221;  the  problem  of  externalities  like  noise,
        smell, shade, etc.. In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict
        building size. The Equitable Building was so large that the price
        of office space plummeted. Zoning limited building volume so
        that didn&#8217;t happen again. Berkeley implmented an early zoning
        plan for other reasons. &#8221;Residential areas&#8221; kept apartments of
        poor (including &#8221;negroes and Orientals&#8221;) out of the suburbs.
        Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese) out
        of the suburbs. Berkeley&#8217;s zoning was non-heirarchical &#8212; it kept
        residential out of industrial areas. This was used by business
        interests to force housing out of downtown areas and attract

        more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue). Zoning drives up
        prices. Single-room occupancies (SROs) are banned. Parking
        required. Heights limited. Empty land mandated. The approval
        process delays housing. Etc. It makes cities worse and America
        poorer. Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation. By race
        and class. Fixing the problems requires loosening zoning, but
        the author considers abolishing it all together. Zoning doesn&#8217;t
        accomplish its goals. It doesn&#8217;t address most externalities and,
        those it does, it does roughly. It isn&#8217;t the best mechanism for
        planning  growth.  Houston  is  the  example  of  a  city  without
        zoning. Most of its residents&#8217; desire for zoning is fulfilled by deed
        restrictions, which are enforced by the city government. Some of
        zoning&#8217;s aspects show up elsewhere (don&#8217;t build in a floodplain,
        optional parking minimums, some business banned everywhere
        in the city). Houston is still segregated by use, but that is driven
        by the market. I wish the author had gone into more detail
        on this important aspect of the solution: &#8221;As Siegan observes,
        it&#8217;s not uncommon for homeowners&#8217; associations to simply pay
        off owners of abutting properties to avoid more offensive uses,
        such as gas stations or car dealerships&#8221;. (Page 155) The author
        says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs to change. Laws
        need to focus on externalities directly, like noise and smell.
        Planner&#8217;s  duties  can  be  replaced  by  mediators.  The  author
        says that planning needs to fight the segregation that it helped
        create. Not just remove zoning, but use the federal Low-Income
        Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Section 8 vouchers to put
        poorer families in high-opportunity areas. The author believe
        inclusionary zoning is bad. He supports community land trusts
        (CLT). (I find CLTs very very expensive for their benefit.)</p></div>

        <p class="bibitem-p" >This is an executive summary of inclusive zoning. It describes

        it  and  its  effects.  It  has  a  summary  of  6  different  studies
        of inclusionary zoning. &#8221;... four find that inclusionary zoning
        increases prices.&#8221; The author points out that all these studies
        assume the cities&#8217; restrictive zoning policy is &#8221;a given&#8221;. In the
        conclusion she states: &#8221;No studies of its effects indicate that
        it  increases  housing  supply  or  contributes  to  broadly  lower
        prices. It benefits a small portion of low and moderate-income
        households rather than targeting aid at the households that
        need it most.&#8221;</p></div>

        <p class="bibitem-p" >This research evaluates walkability&#8217;s effect on home prices on
        a zipcode basis. I don&#8217;t trust this paper&#8217;s results at all. The
        paper&#8217;s literature review says that Walk Score sometimes didn&#8217;t
        line up with real walkability on small scales. Hence, it would
        be  odd  to  see  its  effect  at  larger  scales,  like  zipcode.  The
        Walk Score for a zipcode was taken at its centroid. The other
        variables  were  average  rooms,  average  housing  age,  average
        commute time, average distance to CBD, income, vacancy, and
        density.  They  controlled  for  county-level  fixed  effects.  (The
        hope this adjusts for crime and public amenities.) They regress
        log(price-per-sqft) with linear effects. It isn&#8217;t clear if that is a
        sqft of land or interior space. They use linear average income,
        not  log(average  income),  which  is  strange.  In  the  results,
        they say &#8221;The coefficients on distance from the CBD, average
        commute... are insignficant&#8221;. That&#8217;s a bad sign. They attempt
        to validate the model with rental rates, which I would think
        would be the primary way to measure the effects. The authors
        find price increases with Walk Score. But zip codes are not
        randomly  drawn  &#8212;  they  were  drawn  for  delivery  of  postal
        mail. Nor is the centroid of them random. The Walk Score
        varies on a small scale and they should be measuring it on

        that scale. I don&#8217;t think they take enough confounding variables
        into account. Even with the ones they do, they find a negative
        coefficient for both commute distance and distance to CBD. I
        don&#8217;t trust these results at all.</p></div>
