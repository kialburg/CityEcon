  A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.  It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and safety, protect the environment, plan for the future).  Zoning doesn't even "solve" the problem of externalities like noise, smell, shade, etc..  

   In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict building size.  The Equitable Building was so large that the price of office space plummeted.  Zoning limited building volume so that didn't happen again. 

   Berkeley implmented an early zoning plan for other reasons.  "Residential areas" kept apartments of poor (including "negroes and Orientals") out of the suburbs.  Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese) out of the suburbs.  Berkeley's zoning was non-heirarchical --- it kept residential out of industrial areas.  This was used by business interests to force housing out of downtown areas and attract more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue).  

   Zoning drives up prices.  Single-room occupancies (SROs) are banned.  Parking required.  Heights limited.  Empty land mandated.  The approval process delays housing.  Etc.  It makes cities worse and America poorer.

   Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation.  By race and class.

   Fixing the problems requires loosening zoning, but the author considers abolishing it all together.  Zoning doesn't accomplish its goals.  It doesn't address most externalities and, those it does, it does roughly.  It isn't the best mechanism for planning growth.  

   Houston is the example of a city without zoning.  Most of its residents' desire for zoning is fulfilled by deed restrictions, which are enforced by the city government.  Some of zoning's aspects show up elsewhere (don't build in a floodplain, optional parking minimums, some business banned everywhere in the city).  Houston is still segregated by use, but that is driven by the market.   I wish the author had gone into more detail on this important aspect of the solution: "As Siegan observes, it's not uncommon for homeowners' associations to simply pay off owners of abutting properties to avoid more offensive uses, such as gas stations or car dealerships".  (Page 155) 

   The author says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs to change.  Laws need to focus on externalities directly, like noise and smell.  Planner's duties can be replaced by mediators.

    The author says that planning needs to fight the segregation that it helped create.  Not just remove zoning, but use the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Section 8 vouchers to put poorer families in high-opportunity areas.  The author believe inclusionary zoning is bad.  He supports community land trusts (CLT). (I find CLTs very very expensive for their benefit.) }
