    The authors felt that the press, public, and even policy makers had a mistaken view of the causes of homelessness.  They wanted to present simple plots of data showing that many commonly discussed "causes" are not the cause.  And that the price of housing was.

     Page 13 and 14 have a great metaphor: musical chairs.  A person with a cast doesn't get a seat, but it isn't because he cannot get to a chair.  It is because there is 1 fewer chairs than people.  Such is homelessness --- we see a lot of individual factors (mental health, addiction, race, etc.) that affect who doesn't gets a home, but we need to look at citywide factors that cause a home shortage.

     The data is strange.  They want to use the 35 largest cities by metro area.  (Why 35??)  They drop 6 because HUD's Continuity of Care (CoC) region covers "too large a geographic area".  The dropped cities are Houston, Riverside (CA), Denver, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City (MO).  The rest are split into two groups, where the CoC matches the city (20 of them) or the county (10 of them).  Chicago appears in both groups.  They cover years 2007 to 2019, but admit that the PIT Count (their measure of homelessness) is iffy in some cities and especially in the early few years.

     Over time, homelessness has dropped on average.  But the variance has increased.

     They talk about the PIT Count ("homeless census").  Most homelessness is temporary, but some is long-term.  Because the PIT Count is a single day, it emphasizes the long-term.  If it was people over the year, the temporary ones would show up more.

     Homeless are more likely to be: male, unmarried, low-income, old, non-white, and queer.  They are socially isolated: fewer family ties and far from family.  They are more likely to be depressed, mentally ill, abused drugs, abuse alcohol, have a conviction and been incarcerated.  70\% are individuals, usually male.  30\% are families, which tend to undergo temporary homelessness.

    Cost per homeless is \$30,000 to \$100,000 for government services.


    The book has good data on poverty, which is negatively correlated with homelessness.  Unemployment is negatively correlated with homelessness.  It is odd that they plot data points for every year and don't estimate fixed-effects for cities.  (E.g., does an increase in poverty cause an increase in homelessness?)

    Mental illness and drug use are measured on a statewide-basis.  That seems to large a scale.

    Race is negatively correlated with homelessness.   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but cities with more Black residents have a lower rate of homelessness!

    Temperature is handled badly.  They use the average temperature for the month of January ... even though the PIT Count was on a specific day?  The county data shows no correlation of warmer winters with homelessness, but the city data does.  They fight that result by combining the data using "indexed homelessness" (described on pages 20 to 22) which is, let's say, not a well-known technique.  The annedotal evidence --- that cold NYC has more homeless than warm southern cities --- is much stronger than their data.

    They admit that temperature is correlated with unsheltered homeless.  They explain that this may be because cold cities spend more on shelter than warmer cities, which may spend on outdoor services.

    Generous social services is also done differently.  It measures the state's maximum TANF ("Welfare") benefit against family homelessness rate.  It uses families, because individuals rarely qualify for TANF.  This does not seem like a good measure.

    The show that low-income migration is negatively correlated with homelessness.  They try to say this shows the cities with high homelessness are not "welfare magnets".  To me, that data means other things.

    They handle political party annecdotally, citing that Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland are highly Democratic cities with low homelessness.  The authors inveigh against harsh police treatment of the homeless and say there is no evidence that it does more than hide the problem.

    They do a strange interlude to look at cost-burden-ness as a cause of homelessness.  They find when the median person spend more on housing, homelessness goes down in cities.  But not in counties.  And the result doesn't hold when looking at the "first-quartile housing cost burden".

    What should be the finale is the comparison of median rent, vacancy, first-quartile rent, and "first-quartile vacancy" (vacancy in lowest 1/4 rent apartments).  Rent and vacancy are inversely correlated and both predict homelessness.  The strongest is median rent which has an R-squared of 55\% for cities and first-quartile rent which has an R-squared of 28\% for counties.  (For vacancy, they regress against log(vacancy), which is a strange choice since both homeless rate and vacancy are on a scale of 0 to 100\%.  They don't apply log to rent, where it would be more natural.  And they don't do log(vacancy) when showing it correlates with rent.  These are inconsistent strange choices.)

    Page 134 says that they did a full model with fixed-city effects ... but don't show its results.  Not even in an appendix.  WTF.  

    The rest of the book doesn't follow their thesis.  They see if growth is correlated with homelessness and find it isn't.  They mention a study shows that inequality is causal ... but say it isn't in their data (without any plots).

   They eventually say that economics believe supply is limited by geography (oceans, mountains, etc.) and by regulation.  They then group cities by elasticity (a measure of supply limitations) and growth.  (So, now, they're saying growth \emph{does} matter.)  And the worst cities have high growth and low elasticity.  I expected the book to end here saying "we need to fix the regulation in high-growth cities".

    But, no.  We get 38 pages of their vague plan to fix homelessness.  After a data-driven book focused on proving one point, it is huge jumble of opinion at the finish.  They dismiss filtering without a citation on page 134.  They put together a mushy argument against markets on pages 171 to 173.  They say private markets won't create houses for people with no income, but ignore the idea of giving money to those people.  After citing economists ealier, they say "housing must be de-commodified".  They mention that building houses has not come down in price like building iPhones, but don't mention that most cities ban manufactured homes on most land.  It goes on: public perception, funding, and more.  Way too much for a single chapter.  

    The book's data is passable --- it is clear enough to make most of their thesis's points --- but I think it needs a much stronger analysis in an appendix.  The book never really addressed how to handle correlations in data samples from the same city in different years.   The writing began well but it totally flubbed the landing.  The last chapter should have been cut and become the basis for the author's next book.  But it did well enough to make its point and that's an accomplishment.

  A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.  It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and safety, protect the environment, plan for the future).  Zoning doesn't even "solve" the problem of externalities like noise, smell, shade, etc..  

   In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict building size.  The Equitable Building was so large that the price of office space plummeted.  Zoning limited building volume so that didn't happen again. 

   Berkeley implmented an early zoning plan for other reasons.  "Residential areas" kept apartments of poor (including "negroes and Orientals") out of the suburbs.  Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese) out of the suburbs.  Berkeley's zoning was non-heirarchical --- it kept residential out of industrial areas.  This was used by business interests to force housing out of downtown areas and attract more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue).  

   Zoning drives up prices.  Single-room occupancies (SROs) are banned.  Parking required.  Heights limited.  Empty land mandated.  The approval process delays housing.  Etc.  It makes cities worse and America poorer.

   Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation.  By race and class.

   Fixing the problems requires loosening zoning, but the author considers abolishing it all together.  Zoning doesn't accomplish its goals.  It doesn't address most externalities and, those it does, it does roughly.  It isn't the best mechanism for planning growth.  

   Houston is the example of a city without zoning.  Most of its residents' desire for zoning is fulfilled by deed restrictions, which are enforced by the city government.  Some of zoning's aspects show up elsewhere (don't build in a floodplain, optional parking minimums, some business banned everywhere in the city).  Houston is still segregated by use, but that is driven by the market.   I wish the author had gone into more detail on this important aspect of the solution: "As Siegan observes, it's not uncommon for homeowners' associations to simply pay off owners of abutting properties to avoid more offensive uses, such as gas stations or car dealerships".  (Page 155) 

   The author says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs to change.  Laws need to focus on externalities directly, like noise and smell.  Planner's duties can be replaced by mediators.

    The author says that planning needs to fight the segregation that it helped create.  Not just remove zoning, but use the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Section 8 vouchers to put poorer families in high-opportunity areas.  The author believe inclusionary zoning is bad.  He supports community land trusts (CLT). (I find CLTs very very expensive for their benefit.)

     The paper's literature review says that Walk Score sometimes didn't line up with real walkability on small scales.  Hence, it would be odd to see its effect at larger scales, like zipcode.

     The Walk Score for a zipcode was taken at its centroid.  The other variables were average rooms, average housing age, average commute time, average distance to CBD, income, vacancy, and density.  They controlled for county-level fixed effects.  (The hope this adjusts for crime and public amenities.)  They regress log(price-per-sqft) with linear effects.  It isn't clear if that is a sqft of land or interior space.   They use linear average income, not log(average income), which is strange.  In the results, they say "The coefficients on distance from the CBD, average commute... are insignficant".  That's a bad sign.

     They attempt to validate the model with rental rates, which I would think would be the primary way to measure the effects.

     The authors find price increases with Walk Score.  But zip codes are not randomly drawn --- they were drawn for delivery of postal mail.  Nor is the centroid of them random.  The Walk Score varies on a small scale and they should be measuring it on that scale.  I don't think they take enough confounding variables into account.  Even with the ones they do, they find a negative coefficient for both commute distance and distance to CBD.  I don't trust these results at all.

    A touching and enlightening article.  The author explains how she delt with poverty by occasionally living in her car.

    It covers a lot of the practical issues of being homeless.  Low pay and expensive housing cause homelessness.  Landlords have requirements (deposit, proof of income, etc.) and discriminate against homeless (let alone incarcerated, etc.).  Roommates are problematic: propositions for sex, mental health, lack of privacy, etc..  When you live in your car, you need to find a place to park at night.  

    The most important section is the first: "Homelessness is expensive".  It opened my eyes to how costs \emph{increase} as you go down the ladder.  Without a stove, you must buy pre-cooked food and cannot buy in bulk.  Without storage, you must buy a new winter coat each year.  Without a shower, you need to buy a gym membership to get clean.  With all those higher costs, trying to "climb up the ladder" is harder the lower you are.

    This is the kindest, wholehearted, literate attack I've ever read.  It is dense with ideas and feelings and examples.

    The first sentence is "This book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding."  The victims of the attack are architects and planners who think that the best cities have tall buildings in park-like environments.  (These go by brand names "City Beautiful", "Garden City" and "Radiant City".)  She also attacks governments who subsidize suburbs and who essentailly "clear the slums and rebuild". 

    Her first chapter is on Safety.  She defines a city as a place with a lot of strangers and the residents of a city block (people living there and business owners) need to defend themselves from strangers.  There are 2 ways to do this.  One way is to demark "Turfs" which are patrolled by gangs (in poor areas) or private security guards (in rich ones).  The alternative is an organic defense: the dangerous person is detected, the alarm communicated to fellow residents, and enough residents mass in the street to fend off the danger.  This organic defense only comes through visibility of danger, stability of residents, communication, building of trust through voluntary interactions, and fast response. 

    The organic defense is encouraged by fostering interaction of residents on sidewalks using mixed-use, short blocks, high traffic at all hours, recreation in public rather than private, etc.  You also need big windows looking over street, no blind spots, etc..  Parks are bad --- plenty of blind spots, far from windows, usually low-traffic.  It's where gangs fight, where boys sneak off to do bad things, and where the homeless gather.  A few parks, which are small and have traffic at all hours with various crowds at different times, are successes.  Activity-based amenties, like swimming pools (and libraries?), can be good.  In addition to parks, other borders between streets, like highways, railroads and rivers, also cut the organic fabric.  

   Chapter 6's title says "neighborhoods" but means "governing".  The author doesn't see a boundary for a neighborhood --- the city is a continuous piece of overlapping relationships: friends, customers of business, schools, etc..  In her mind, there is your block and your city and nothing in between.  She says there is a political role to be played by districts of size about 100,000.  Basically, no citywide politician cares about your block.  You need a district size to be where someone on your block can gather enough voices from nearby blocks to get the attention of an assemblyman at the city level and that the assemblyman has enough power to get stuff done with the police, the traffic planners, etc..  She comments that many cities are not very democratic because of their structure and hoops that residents must try to run through.

    Quote from pg. 181, "Here is a seeming paradox: To maintain in a neighborhood sufficient people who stay put, a city must have the very fluidity and mobility of use ..."

    I have not read Chapters 7 through 15 yet.

    Chapter 15 is about money.  There is real damage done to neighborhoods that could not get loans because banks blacklisted them after planners designated them as "slums" or bad.  Existing buildings are not improved; bad buildings are not torn down and replaced.  Her early example of Boston's North End is brought up.  It was only sustained and improved by people paying cash and by construction people living there.  When money does flood into a slum, it often displaces residents and destroys the social fabric.

    Tax law also drove people to be slumlords.  Owners did not invest so that profits came as capital gains rather than income.  

    The author mentions that eminant domain hurts because it pays only for the land/building and not everything the owner had invested betting on a stable future.  Some cities have "quick-take" laws that grab the land immediately and settle the price later, so that profiteers cannot buy property that will be later eminantly domained.

    Chapter 16 is about subsidized housing.  The author has sharp comments about lack of housing is about lack of money.  She recommends subsidizing rent and guaranteed loans to building owners who provide it.  She would let owners choose their residents.  

    I did not read Chapters 17 through the end.

    I didn't have time to read all of this book but I want to!  It is an engaging and eye-opening.  The author has new ideas with lots of examples.  The author never uses the words "organic fabric", but that's what she means.  It's a difficult concept for planning --- improving may require a local "gardener" rather than a distance mathematical bureaucrat.  Even the first question that I'd want to ask, "how do you measure it?", is a quandry.  Page 174-179 talks about the social network in a neighborhood and mentions the number of connections between any two people.  It's a kind of "six-degrees" but within the neighborhood.  Perhaps that's a way to measure it.  But the next question, "what do planners do to make a neighborhood better connected?" gets even more complex.  Even if there's complexity, the author has redirected everyone's gaze at it.

    The author builds economic models to explain homelessness.

    The basic model has 3 levels of housing: homeless, low quality, and high quality.  Agents have an income and a standard utility model, increasing in money and home quality.  The model demonstrates that poor people, in the right situtations, will choose homelessness.

    The author extends this to a model with a continuum of quality ranges, from 0 to positive infinity.   And then adds construction of homes, maintenance, filtering, etc..  Models are similar to filtering models of Sweeney 1974 and Arnott 1987.

    On page 49, the author looks at "compartive dynamics".  That is, how changes in income distribution, interest rates, and other factors affect the housing market.  I didn't read all the details.

    Other aspects of housing are considered: rent collection costs, public housing, shelters, building codes, and tastes.

    I think the model is more complicated than necessary to explain the homelessness dynamics.  There isn't any data connecting it to the real world.  Still, the author seems pretty happy with it.

    The book starts pretty boring.  Chapter 2 is a discussion of the various definitions of "homeless".  For example, are people in a shelter "homeless"?   Chapter 3 is an undramatic discussion of why homelessness is bad for other people.  Strangely, for an economist, it doesn't try to put it in financial terms.  Chapter 4 is a history of homelessness and data for it.  Which is pretty awful, up to 1996.

    Chapter 5 is interesting: it compares the homeless, who sleep outdoors or in shelters, to what most people call "homeless", the people that beg, collect cans, and wash windshields.  He refers to those as "colloquially homeless" or "daytime streetpeople" or simply "streetpeople".  There is overlap.  The author's study in New York said about 3/4 of streetpeople are homeless, but 1/4 live with someone or have their own place.  Most have slept in a shelter but do not like them.   The streetpeople earn a variable income that is below minimum wage.  Those that reported hours worked around 7 hours a day.  2/3 work 7 days a week; the rest are evenly split between 1 and 6 days a week.   3/4 say they would take a low-wage job.  About 1/2 get public assistance, which might go away with a job.  If given extra money, about 1/3 said they would spend it on alcohol or drugs.  2/3 said they didn't have a way to save money!  

    Chapter 6 describes an economic model of housing and homelessness, without any equations.  But it uses phrases like "price-quality schedule", so good luck understanding the chapter without an advanced econ degree.  I have one and, for me, it might have been easier with some equations.  The model has a high-end market, where houses are built and maintained, a low-end market, where houses are not maintained and deteriorate in quality, and, finally, homelessness.  The interesting part is the low-end market, where changes in costs ripple down determine who is homeless.  It is a model of a market at equilbrium and the author walks through various scenarios that will change the equilibrium.  They're summarized in Table 6-1 at the end of the chapter.  It is a well-constructed model but I'm not sure how well it represents reality.  Buildings take decades to age, so are cities actually near equilibrium?  Also, the

The median shelter homeless spell is well under a month, and even “chronic homelessness” officially entails spells of a year or so. I model homelessness as part of people’s lives in a dynamic stochastic framework in continuous time. I can explain many empirical regularities with a parsimonious model: for instance, why the last addresses of homeless people are concentrated in a few low-rent neighborhoods, why homeless entries are hard to predict, why recidivism is common and past homelessness is a good predictor of future homelessness, why some groups recidivate more often than others, why the hazard rate for shelter exit is single-peaked, why effective homelessness prevention programs do not alter the average length of homeless spells. I also examine policy. The optimal homelessness prevention program is Pigouvian and starkly simple. With an optimal prevention program in place, optimal shelter quality maximizes a simple and intuitive expression, and insurance programs always raise social welfare. Most of the previous economics literature about homelessness has been static, but most literature about homelessness outside economics has been dynamic. This paper tries to bring the two strands of literature closer together.},

    The author builds a simple stocastic-calculus model of an individual's wealth and, when their wealth falls to zero, the individual goes homeless.   By "simple", I mean it is still stocastic calculus and heavy on the math.

    The author's model leads to an obvious policy: a "Pigouvian homelessness prevention program".  That is, assuming homelessness has negative externalities (like smoking causes second-hand lung cancer), the government pays a subsidy if you are housed (like subsidizing people not to smoke).  Usually the Pigouvian response is a tax, like a heavy cigarette tax, but taxing the homeless would be cruel.   He says "he optimal shelter quality (and street enforcement regime) maximizes the instantaneous difference between benefits and costs".  

    Another policy is income smoothing.  He concludes that "any actuarily fair insurance that reduces volatility is welfare-improving.".

    This paper research into homelessness by economists and practioners.

    It has an interesting discussion of the strengths of studies that focus on individual vs. averages.  Practioners want individual studies, since it informs how they act.  But they don't provide information on solving homelessness.

    It has some interesting insights on the "general equilibrium", by which the author means how everyone in the housing market reacts to a policy.  A shelter is more pleasant than sleeping rough, so more shelters means that fewer will sleep rough and, also, that some people will stay longer.  So, Housing First treats the homeless, but there aren't studies on what it does to the system.

    One simple model has a rate $e$ at which the homed become homeless and a rate $x$ at whick the homeless become homed.  The steadystate homeless rate is $e/x$.  

    Discusses treatments, where money seems to be best.  Mentions that rent is factor.   Some non-housing interventions help, but they're relatively expensive.

    Journeys Home is a longitudinal study that covers Australians beyond homelessness.  It produced a lot of good data.  For men, trauma was seen on entering and exiting homelessness.  Women experienced trauma while homeless.  Violence might cause male homelessness, but not female.   Addiction, in general, was not a cause of homelessness.  Although heavy alcohol use (a binge)might be causal. 

    An increase in EITC payments lead to fewer families doubling up.  But it didn't decrease homelessness.  The author asks "Why might this be?" and guesses either it has to do with averages or the near-homeless didn't apply for EITC.

    Evictions often preceed homelessness.  Giving legal representation during evictions help prevent them.  But no one has studied if landlords change in response.

    He casts a lot of doubt on HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report.  This includes the Point-in-Time Count ("homeless census", "PIT Count").

    His own paper (2003) looked at shelter quality and the quality of living outside (rain, worse spots to camp) and computed an equilibrium for how many homeless would choose each.  It says how the number of beds affects numbers too --- meaning 100 more beds reduces the PIT Count by much fewer than 100!  Permanent supportive housing is very high quality housing and has a predictable effect.  

    When prisoners are released, shelter numbers do not increase.  But that may be because recently released criminals scare people away?

    If housing is given to those homeless longest, it might incentivize people to stay homeless longer to increase their odds of "winning a lottery".  

   Corinth 2017 has formula for predicting homelessness.

   NYC ran a service "Homebase" which prioritized treated people in their neighborhoods.  I'm not sure all the details, but it kept social connections.

   Prevention is tricky.  Rolston et al. found 14.5\% of their control group entered shelters and 8.0\% of the treatment group.  Since only 6.5\% were affected, the program could be expensive for the effect.

   People have private information on how likely they are to be homeless.  Still, practioners may find it hard to get honest answers when the treatment depends on the answer.  The Homebase program saw evidence with long walks to services.  The NYC housing program does it by requiring long stays at a shelter before getting housing support.

   In NYC, homelessness increased from 2011 to 2017, but the housing market was mostly unchanged.  Vacancy in low-rent apartments fell by 1/3, but it was not significant.  Migration doesn't explain shifts in numbers, even in the NY/NJ area.   LA saw a similar rise in the city but not surrounding areas.

   Under Mayor De Blasio, NYC raised \$-per-family-day from \$103 to \$171.  (NYC sometimes rents hotel rooms and that's close to the price of one.)

   On page 62, does a "thought experiment" of how many Housing Choice Vouchers would be necessary to replace NYC's shelters and other programs.  He believes the money currently spent (\$1.8 billion) might be able to do it.
   
   Pg. 66 says LA's survey is different from NYC in major ways.  E.g., visual not interviews.  No transit.  Non-random.  Crappy in every way.   

   LA spends far less on homeless services: 1/15th that of NYC!   That rose to about 1/3 in 2017.   "prevention in Los Angeles might also require \$30,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1".  Wow.  He compares that to rent subsidies, which in NYC, cost \$40,000 to \$80,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1. 

   Economists have not studied the unsheltered homeless.  Is the difference between cities a matter of enforcement?

   Veterans saw a big decrease in homelessness from 2010 to 2016.  But the age range for high homelessness (18 to 64) also fell sharply.  There was a large voucher program (HUD-VASH) but it may have had little effect.

   Homeless families fell by 2/3s between 2010 and 2017.  It could be because NY state takes kids from homeless families and other states copied that.  There are other possibilities.

   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but states with more Black residents tend to have fewer homeless.  Drug rates, alcohol abuse, and mental illness are the same rate in Blacks as in other groups.  The proportion of Black incarcerated is similar to those homeless.  The author says another candidate explanation is segregation: a shelter full of Black people may be offputting to White people.  (But wouldn't that push up the number of unsheltered White homeless?)

    The conclusion says: "We don't know how to end homelessness."  "We can't explain why homelessness in the two biggest American cities exploded in this decade, or why it fell in the rest of the country."  "On an aggregate level, weather, labor market conditions, and housing prices affect homelessness, and maybe policies too, but modest changes in unemployment or rents cannot be expected to trigger huge changes in homelessness."  "...; for the most effective policies a handful ro two of people have to be treated to reduce aggregate homelessness by one."   "It's a good time for more economists to start working on homelessness."

  abstract={It is generally believed that the increased incidence of homelessness in the US has arisen from broad societal factors - changes in the institutionalization of the mentally ill, increases in drug addiction and alcohol usage, etc. This paper reports on a comprehensive test of the alternate hypothesis that variations in homelessness arise from changed circumstances in the housing market and in the income distribution. We utilize essentially all the systematic information available on homelessness in US urban areas - census counts, shelter bed counts, records of transfer payments, and administrative agency estimates. We use these data to estimate the effects of housing prices, vacancies, and rentto-income ratios upon the incidence of homelessness. Our results suggest that simple economic principles governing the availability and pricing of housing and the growth in demand for the lowest quality housing explain a large portion of the variation in homelessness among US metropolitan housing markets. Furthermore, rather modest improvements in the affordability of rental housing or its availability can substantially reduce the incidence of homelessness in the US.},

     I quickly skimmed this paper.

     It tries to find the contributing factors to homelessness.

     It first looks at the theory that the mentally ill were no longer in institutions.  It finds the prison population increased proportionally.  The remaining 34,000 were too few to account for the 100,000+ increase in homeless over the period.

     They interpret O’Flaherty (1996) as saying income inequality can lead to a class of older housing where rent is too low to pay for the maintenance.  Thus, residents must choose between substandard housing or homelessness.  (Note to self: the oldest housing in Austin is near downtown.  Growth has caused the least-valuable buildings to be on very valuable land.  Has this wrecked filtering?)  

     Did not finish.

     Brendan O'Flaherty mentioned this as one paper connecting homelessness to inequality.

    Slides on a proposed amendment to Austin's zoning to allow "units" of 200 sqft.  The minimum at the time was 400 sqft. 

    The amendment would still require 400 sqft per unit on the site.  And, require 0.6 parking spots per unit.  And, require 10\% affordable units!  AND, it would only be allowed on a "CTC", which I think is a "core transit corridor", but not districts that already have affordability requirements, live VMU! WTF!!!

    The Director of Austin's Planning and Development Review responded to City Council request to look at "micro units", which have less than 500 square feet of space.  It defines them and the restrictions in Austin's zoning and building code.

    He says micro units are already legal to build, as small as 250 sqft., but other parts of the code interfere with building them.   "Site area requirements specify the minimum amount of land required per dwelling unit. In Austin’s zoning code, these requirements differ depending on the zoning district.  ... Under Austin’s current code, the smallest site area requirement is 800 square feet, for efficiency units located in MF-5 zoning."

    Also, there is a parking requirement.  He says "Austin’s multifamily use requires at least one space per dwelling, unless it meets one of the above conditions for reduced parking.  That means that aside from CBD and DMU zoning districts, a multifamily development will have close to one parking spot per dwelling
(at the 20\% central core reduction) or more."

    Focuses on William A. Niskanen's theory that bureaucrats maximize their agency's discretionary budget.  Presumes it can be measured by looking at City Managers who contract outside.  When going outside, the price is visible to their "polical sponsor".  So, if City Managers contract outside more than other top city officials, it validates the theory.  

    Concludes: "City manager cities are slightly more likely to contract out. This general pattern of contracting out is more in line with the professionalism in government hypothesis than the greedy bureaucrat hypothesis."
