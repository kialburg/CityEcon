\emph{These are the Urban Economics papers that I've read and my notes on them.  The notes are often incomplete, partial sentences, and biased.  Some papers were only skimmed.}

\emph{These notes were written for me.  I've published them because, even if they are imperfect, they might be useful to others.  I hope they get you up to speed quicker, find new references, or get a second opinion on a reference.  If you find them useful, email me to let me know.}

\emph{If you're an author of one of these papers and think I missed or misinterpreted something important in your paper, email me. }
