    - rent is right metric
    - not rising as rapidly as prices
    ! doesn't mention black market housing
    - rent increases slightly in London, but prices go up dramatically.  Rest of country sees rents fall and prices remain steady.  (Except in Northeast, where both fall.)
    - children stay at home longer   (? could this be part of the volume-discount effect?  More people = large house for cheaper price per-sqft.)
    - says rent have fallen relative to median household income ... but that's not the right metric!

    - Minneapolis upto 2018
    - new construction near high-cost housing lowered rents.
    - new construction near low-cost housing increased rents (very slightly after adjusting for inflation).
    - ? is this that rich people move into new construction and people want to live near rich people?  (and the new amenties that come to serve them.)
    - ? Also, if land in the area is more expensive, do landlords pass that on to residents?
    - ? Also, if the land value is increasing in the future, do landlords need to be paid _not_ to redevelop the property right now?
    - doesn't mention filtering effects

For value of land near transit:
   Jonathan Levine, "Zoned Out: Regualtion, Markets and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land Use" 2005


Yan Song and Gerrit Knapp, “New Urbanism and Housing Values: A Disaggregate Assessment,”
Journal of Urban Economics 54, no. 2 (2003); Yan Song and Gerrit Knapp, “Measur ing the Effects of
Mixed Land Uses on Housing Values,” Regional Science and Urban Economics 34 (2004).
   - used GIS to measure walkability and value in Portland.  Emily Hamilton says "they find that proximity to nonresidential amenities increases the value of single-family homes. They find that while multifamily housing and industrial uses may lower home values, service-oriented businesses and parks increase home values."


Matthew Resseger "The Impact of Land Use Regulation on Racial Segregation: Evidence from Massachusetts Zoning Borders"
https://scholar.harvard.edu/resseger/jmp
   - finds that half of segregation is due to zoning, especially multi-family vs single-family zoning.
