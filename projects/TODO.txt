Ideas for projects:

- GIS projects
    - Add political boundaries (10 districts) to maps?
    - compare TCAD to Zillow
    - look for odd ball valuations in data
    - Map of mobile homes?
    - Connect addresses to ages of people in voting records ... determine how much the young pay more taxes in Austin!

- Map of cannot-be-split lots
    - Use GIS to generate map of most common zoning and lot size
        - lots smaller than minimum lot size
        - lots less than twice minimum lot size
        - all other lots

- Map of tax-shift to inner neighborhoods
   - Map tax-paid increase from 2010 to 2020 (or so) by single-family lot

- redo UT filtering study, but include distance to center of city!

- generate 1D histogram of Austin
    -try to show different types and average building size and drive time from city

- histograms of lot size at each distance from the center of city
    - show that smaller lots are demanded as you get closer, but city doesn't allow them.


- If demand is constant (57% of consumption goes to housing and transportation) for all consumption levels and consumption is log-normal and there's a volume discount of X% for every doubling of housing size (land or interior space or both), what is the distribution of housing by income level?
   -  Quick post showing rent is super-linear with average GDP?
   - Use Gyourko & Glaeser's estimates of average and marginal cost-per-acre to figure out real-world valus?
       - https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/03v09n2/0306glae.pdf
   - ACS data on housing consumption distribution + Zillow scrape of land+interiorspace volume discounts


- Write up list of metrics for cities regarding housing
    - must be able to be gathered at reasonable cost
    - must be clearly "better higher" or "better lower"
    - must be within reasonable control of city government and their policy

- Blackmarket housing in Austin, TX
   - collect interviews
   -  Can I use census records to find where undocumented migrants live and/or where blackmarket housing is?

- Show demand is constant (57%) for housing and transportation
    - show that "cost burdened" households are actually riding public transportation
        - Plot # of cost burdened households vs. # riding transit

- Interview homeless based on economic decisions


- Build 10-cent homeless simulator
    - basically a game playable in 5 minutes on a cellphone, but underneath is a game theory game / finite state machine / markov model of how it is to live on the streets.
    - score is summed happiness
    - happiness comes from food, warmth, cleanliness, etc.  (? going to bathroom)
    - trade-offs are time and money to generate happiness
    - can stay in apartment, shelter, tent, etc.
    - can have car, bike, winter clothes, rain clothes, etc.
s
    - can have family connection to help, but they may cut you off
    - sleeping badly loses you hours
    - various random incidents --- being robbed, sickness, car stops working, etc.  
    - have N hours in day, need to travel to eat, travel to work, etc.
    - addiction means drugs/alcohol give you happiness, but also affects future happiness.  Can have random chance of going on a mindless binge.
    - depression loses you hours.  criminal record makes jobs harder to get.  disability slows walking.
    - being a woman opens up prostitution as an option.  (Is this why few women are homeless?)  May also allow less-direct means of trading sex for shelter/food/etc..
    - ! demonstrate that living in cheap apartment w/ public transit is cheaper and that living on the streets is more expensive
    - !!! can program AI to play game.  Then can test interventions based on AI's increase in score!!!


- build 1D simulation of a city
    - javascript animation of households moving, buildings getting taller, etc..
    - need equations for:
        - how households decide where to live (and when they choose homelessness)
	- how land-owners price land and split/join lots
	- how someone decided how tall to build a building
	- how landlord sets rates for each building
    - start with walking as only transportation.  Later, add different transportation layers, car ownership, etc.
    - start with 1 commercial building in center of city, where everyone works.  Expanding to add distributed commercial is difficult.
    - Add zoning to see how height of buildings changes and how decisions are changed.
    - Add competition by having 2 cities.  Then can look at how people move from zoned city to unzoned city.
    
    
- Build an economic model with a fixed amount of housing that can be shared by agents.  Agents are endowed with an income, but also a cost to roommates, and, optionally, a cost to landlords.  (E.g., messy/smelly roommates, destructive renters)  Agents may double-up to afford housing, but some bad roommates will not.  Landlords will not offer housing to some.
