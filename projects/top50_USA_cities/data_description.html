<h1>Top 50 American Cities</h1>

<p><a href="city_dataset.csv">This spreadsheet</a> has a variety of data from the 50 largest cities by estimated metro population in 2021.  It's great for quickly testing an idea to see if a trend exists.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Be aware that the data comes from regions with different bounaries.</strong></p>

<p>HUD's rents are for "Fair Market Rent" (FMR) areas.  HUD's homeless numbers are for "Continuity of Care" (CoC) areas.  These not consistently aligned with metro areas nor cities.</p>

<p>INRIX's regions are also inconsisent.  (San Jose is part of San Francisco, Riverside part of Los Angeles, and Virginia Beach part of Norfolk.)</p>

<p><strong>Warning: times are not necessarily aligned in data</strong></p>

<p>HUD's median rents are <strong>published</strong> in Fiscal Year 2023, but are calculated of earlier data.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Zillow data collection started Sept 17th.</p>

<p>Lots come from Zillow.com.
I only considered "agent listings".
Lots had to be listed in the last 90 days
Went to round(# available) and then searched for "valid" lot
- had sqft
- had road
- had address (may be #0 on that street)
- was residential (not commercial, not parking lot, no alley)
- nothing left on lot (e.g., old foundation)
- not auction (opening bid at auction)</p>

<p>Apartments/Condos/Co-ops from Zillow.com.
1+ beds, 1+ baths
Listed within 30 days.
Valid listings had:
- had sqft
- has address
! counted many rooms at same address as "1".
! only selected ads with single room at address
3rd ad may have been sponsored.  It was counted as a property except when less than 10.</p>
