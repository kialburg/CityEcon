<h1>Software</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.qgis.org">QGIS</a> is free software to view maps and manipulate GIS data.</li>

<h1>Basic Data</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gis.traviscountytx.gov/server1/rest/services/Boundaries_and_Jurisdictions/TCAD_public/MapServer/0">Parcel shapefiles for Travis County</a>  This file holds the polygon boundary of each lot.  This is a HUGE file.  It takes hours to download.  You want to save it to your diskdrive and use the saved copy, rather than download it each time.
<ul>
<li>PROP<em>ID is the key field for identifying parcels</li>
<li>Shape</em>_Area is the parcel's area in square feet.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
